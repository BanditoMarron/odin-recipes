<h3>The beauty of a dish</h3>
<p>
Have you ever been stricken by the sheer glory of the presentation of a meal? Have you felt envy as a friend or the friend of a friend regailed an awed table about their journey to complete a perfect dish? Have you ever wished the teller of that tale was you?
</p>
<p>
Well wish no more! Follow these steps and you, too, may enter the halls of the greats and lay claim to a most reveered glory that will be your legacy!
</p>

<h4>But first- ingredients!</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eggplants</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Oregano</li>
<li>Thyme</li>
<li>Eh. Whatever. Just grab whatever sounds about right!</li>
</ul>

<h4>The right steps</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Grab your ingredients</strong></li>
<p>You'll need them!</p>
<li><strong>Cut whatever needs cutting</strong></li>
<p>It's up to you what the end result of all that chopping looks like! lol!</p>
<li><strong>Mix it all in a bowl</strong></li>
<p>For a hot minute!</p>
<li><strong>Add ingredients</strong></li>
<p>While mixing!</p>
<li><strong>Put it all in a skillet</strong></li>
<p>Oil it up first! You don't want it to stick!</p>
<li><strong>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees</strong></li>
<p>You probably should have done this first, actually... Oh well! Play some minecraft or something until the oven is ready, I don't know! When it is- throw in that skillet!</p>
<li><strong>Take it out of the oven</strong></li>
<p>You did it! YAY! Now cut that baby up and make the bourgeois tears of your enemies flow!</p>
</ol>
