<h3>A hard dish to pass up</h3>
<p>
Mac and Cheese may just be the most perfect dish ever concocted. It's almost impossible to mess up, and even a mediocre one still makes a great comfort meal!
</p>
<p>
Follow our instructions below and you'll have pan of Mac and Cheese that's sure to have your friends saying, "Yeah, I was surprised that it wasn't that bad!".
</p>

<h4>The ingredients you'll need</h4>
<ul>
<li>Salt and Pepper</li>
<li>Pasta</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Milk</li>
</ul>

<h4>The right steps</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Boil some water</strong></li>
<p>Put some water in a pot, put the heat on high, and bring that sucker to a boil!</p>
<li><strong>Throw in the pasta</strong></li>
<p>When the water starts to boil- throw in the pasta!</p>
<li><strong>Strain the pasta</strong></li>
<p>After approximately ten minutes throw the pasta into a strainer- just make sure the strainer is in the sink, though! lol!</p>
<li><strong>Throw it back in the pot</strong></li>
<p>Toss that strained pasta back into the pot!</p>
<li><strong>Mix the ingredients</strong></li>
<p>Toss in the flour, butter, milk, cheese, and spices and mix it all up and place your concoction into an oven-safe, oiled-up pan!</p>
<li><strong>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees</strong></li>
<p>You really need to get in the habit of doing this first... Kill some time playing call of duty or see what your ex is up to on instagram while you wait for the oven to heat up to the appropriate temperature- just don't be wierd about it! When the ovens ready throw that sucker in!</p>
<li><strong>Take it out of the oven</strong></li>
<p>And voila! You're done!</p>
